sprite: has position, velocity
  ship: inherits from sprite, has health
  asteroid: inherits from sprite, has size, damage
  bullet: inherits from sprite, has damage

when asteroid is hit by bullet: create 2 asteroids with size 1 smaller, give them position and velocity, if size was 1 then destroy asteroid, destroy bullet

when ship is hit by asteroid: take damage, brief invincibility?

initialize view: create ship, 3 asteroids with size 3
